Beta build of the Eardish Media File Processor (MFP) service. This project was architected as a true web-service model with an API end-point that packages the request/response objects using standardized JSON. It was built using Symfony2 PHP framework with Composer and direct integration with AWS services (e.g. S3, Cloudfront, etc.). It's primary functionality handles all media file uploads for the Eardish platform and queues up audio/video/photo file processing, slicing, conversions, and cloud distribution.
