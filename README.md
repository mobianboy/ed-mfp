Beta build of the Eardish Media File Processor (MFP) service. This project was architected as a true web-service model with an API end-point that packages the request/response objects using standardized JSON. It was built using Symfony2 PHP framework with Composer and direct integration with AWS services (e.g. S3, Cloudfront, etc.).
